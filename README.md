# GO FUNC YOURSELF

This is just a project I'm starting to add some basic FP functions, and list utility to Go. I'll probably work towards adding more utility here as I see fit.

### Notes

-   Order of Parameters. Breaking from many FP paradigms, This library follows a **data-first API style** (the slice comes first, the function last),
    to feel more Go-like and pipeline-friendly. Be careful with non-commutative functions! You got a problem with it? Go func yourself.
